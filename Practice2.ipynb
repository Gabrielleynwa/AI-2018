    "2.A farmer with his wolf, duck and bag of corn come to the east side of a river they wish to cross. There is a boat at the rivers edge, but of course only the farmer can row. The boat can only hold two things (including the rower) at any one time. If the wolf is ever left alone with the duck, the wolf will eat it. Similarly if the duck is ever left alone with the corn, the duck will eat it. How can the farmer get across the river so that all four arrive safely on the other side?"

    "Problem formulation is the process of deciding what actions PROBLEM FORMULATION and states to consider, given a goal. So, goal formulation, based on the current situation and the agentâ€™s performance GOAL FORMULATION measure, is the first step in problem solving. Goals help organize behavior by limiting the objectives that the agent is trying to achieve and hence the actions it needs to consider. If we did problem formulation first we would not know what to include and what to leave out. That said, it can happen that there is a cycle of iterations between goal formulation, problem formulation, and problem solving until one arrives at a sufficiently useful and efficient solution."
